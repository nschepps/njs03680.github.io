	<H2> What did I do over Spring Break?</H2>
		<P> Over Spring Break, I participated in a Study Away program in Savannah River Site, South Carolina. The program focused on fire ecology, specifically in
		    long leaf pine ecosystems. We had the opportunity to be part of two prescribed burns with the forest service at Savannah River Site.
