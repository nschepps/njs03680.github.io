        <p style="text-align:left;padding: 10px;">I have been playing disc golf with my dad and brother ever since I was
            a kid. We
            played in courses all around
            the United States, including courses in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Arizona, and New York. The
            courses we frequent the most are in Marietta, GA. They are called Wills Park and Oregon Park. Each course
            has 18 holes (like regular golf), with each hole having a variety of obstacles to manuever your disc around,
            such as tress, sharp changes in elevation, streams and rivers, and of course other park visitors. Each
            thrower stands on a concrete platform, called a tee, and drives the disc towards the hole. The hole is a
            metal basket with hanging metal chains to absorb the force of the disc. Scoring works the same for regular
            golf with a typical par 3 or 4 for each hole. However, my family rarely keeps score when we go because it is
            just fun to be out there. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left; color: #347BB2; padding: 10px;">TYPES OF DISCS</h3>

        <div style="text-align: left; padding: 10px;">

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                As with regular golf, which has a variety of clubs, disc golf offers a
                variety of discs for different
                purposes. In the table below, I will go over some characteristics of distance drivers, mid-range discs,
                and
                putters.
            </p>

            <table style="width: 90%; margin: 10px; text-align: left;">
                <tr>
                    <td style="width: 50%">Distance Driver</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Offers more distance than any other disc off the tee</li>
                            <li>Can be hard to control</li>
                            <li>Has aerodynamic shape to maximize flight time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mid-range Discs</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easier to control for beginners</li>
                            <li>Great for all types of shots</li>
                            <li>Especially useful for wooded courses</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Putter</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Very accurate a low speeds</li>
                            <li>Erors are not as sever as with other discs</li>
                            <li>Ideal for short, controlled shots</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>


        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; text-indent: 50px;">
            For the longest time, I only used a distance driver for all my shots. A few years ago I decided to try out
            some other discs, and now I use all three types and have multiple discs. Innova is the leading producer of
            discs in the industry. For more information visit their site <a
                href="https://www.innovadiscs.com/">here</a>.

        <h3 style="text-align: left; color: #347BB2; padding: 10px;">HOW CAN YOU GET STARTED?</h3>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; text-indent: 50px;">
            The best thing about disc golf is that the entrance costs are low, and it is fun for the whole family!
            Wal-Mart sells disc golf kits with 3-5 discs for under $30. We have two courses here in Athens that are
            beautiful and easy to access- Sandy Creek Park and Herman C. Michael Park. Sandy Creek Park does charge a $2
            per person fee, but it is well worth it. This sport makes for a great weekend outing!
